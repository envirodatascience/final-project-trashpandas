ENV 617 Final Project: Trash Pandas

By: Ayushi Khan, Jen Adachi, and Sofia John

In this project we look at global waste and recycling data and explore 3 key variables that might correlate with it. We compiled data, cleaned data, visualized trends, ran statistical analyses, and created maps. 

DATA SOURCES:

1. Country-Level Waste Data:
  
   This dataset provides waste generation quantities and population size for each country (along with a number of other waste variables). These data were aggregated from local waste authorities and literature reviews for each country and compiled by The World Bank. This dataset was last updated in January 2024.

   File name: WAW_country_level_data.csv

2. Country-Level Recycling Rate Data:
  
   This dataset provides the recycling rate for each country. The EPI score (Recycling Rate) is defined as the amount of post-consumer waste recycled divided by the total amount of waste that can be recycled. This data is for 2022 and was collected, analyzed, and presented by The Environmental Performance Index.

3. Country-Level GDP Data:

   This dataset provides the annual GDP for each country, including many years of data. These data come from The World Bank national accounts data and OECD National Accounts data files.

4. Country-Level Urban Data:

   This dataset provides data about the number of people living in urban and rural areas in each country. This dataset contains information spanning multiple years.

5. Country-Level Gender Index Data:

   This dataset provides a gender score for each country. Gender score is calculated by factoring in economic opportunity, educational attainment, health, and political empowerment. These scores are calculated each year by the World Economic Forum. This report is for 2023.
