ENV 617 Final Project: Trash Pandas

By: Ayushi Khan, Jen Adachi, and Sofia John

In this project we look at global waste and recycling data and explore 3 key variables that might correlate with it. We compiled data, cleaned data, visualized trends, ran statistical analyses, and created maps. 

DATA SOURCES:

1. Country-Level Waste Data:
  
   This dataset provides waste generation quantities and population size for each country (along with a number of other variables).

   File name: WAW_country_level_data.csv

2. Country-Level Recycling Rate Data:
  
   This dataset provides the recycling rate for each country. The EPI score is defined as the amount of waste recycled divided by the total amount of waste collected. We used this score as the Recycling Rate.
